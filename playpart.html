    <h1>Krishna babu acts in a play</h1>
    <h3>Title of play: Hedda Gabler
        Author: Henrik Ibsen</h3>
    <P>
     MISS TESMAN.
     We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
     George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
     to look after him ever since he was a little boy.
    </P>
    <p>
     BERTA.
     Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless
     at home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never
     learn to take proper care of an invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
     MISS TESMAN.
     Oh, I shall manage to train her. And of course, you know, I shall take
     most of it upon myself. You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister, my
     dear Berta.
    </p>
    <p>
     BERTA.
     Well, but there's another thing, Miss. I'm so mortally afraid I shan't
     be able to suit the young mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
     MISS TESMAN.
     Oh well--just at first there may be one or two things--
    </p>
    <p>
     BERTA.
     Most like she'll be terrible grand in her ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     MISS TESMAN.
     Well, you can't wonder at that--General Gabler's daughter! Think of
     the sort of life she was accustomed to in her father's time. Don't you
     remember how we used to see her riding down the road along with the
     General? In that long black habit--and with feathers in her hat?
